Micro services is an approach in achieving modularization of an application. The approach is to move away from a monolithic architecture and into modularized separate applications. There are multiple pros to running a micro services architecture. independence is a huge one. The ability to have easy and frequent deployments of an smaller application rather than a slow deployment of a larger application. The benefits of independence micro services failures. When a traditional monolithic applications goes down, so does everything. With micro services, if one micro service goes down, the application can continue to run. 

There are some cons to micro services. One is increase in network latency because of the additional network hops to each micro service. Another is increase effort for monitoring a cluster across micro services and getting deployments workflows in place for each micro service.

For even more detail i would recommend watching the video below. It's long but a very good watch
