Chrome currently holds almost 70% of the browser market share. We haven't seen numbers this high since the Internet Explorer glory days, if you could call them that. Since it's the beginning of the year, I think it's a good time to look back to how we got here.

##### 2002 - Three's Company

Aol, IE and Netscape are the main players. If you were like me in 2002, you connected to the internet via Dial Up. You probably connected through AOL. IE has an unbelievable market share at 83.4% percent. Most of us are browsing sites filled with dancing babies and an address book with page counter at the bottom of the page using IE6 and it's all good.

##### 2004 - Mozilla Enters the picture

It's 2004, some of us are still using dialup, but most likely you're connecting to the internet via DSL. Internet Explorer is still king but we have a new choice in the browser wars. Also in this year, Firefox is announced and released but we'll cover more of Firefox in the 2005.

Digg is started as an experiment in November 2004 by collaborators Kevin Rose, Owen Byrne, Ron Gorodetzky, and Jay Adelson

##### 2005 - Firefox makes a splash

Firefox was actually released in November 2004, but as you can see in the chart below, in less than a year it has already snatched up more than 20% percent of the browser market. Firefox bring a refreshing new way of browsing the internet. 

Jquery is also announced. There are hints of a JavaScript library to use CSS selectors with a more succinct syntax for selecting elements.

##### 2008 - Chrome enters the picture

In the previous year, we say the release of the iPhone in 2007. In 2008 Google Chrome enters the browser world, tugging just a measly 3% of the browser share. IE market share is now cut in half from where we started in this journey thanks to Firefox. Firefox is closing in on taking the lead in the browser wars.

In 2008 Android is released. With the earlier release of the iPhone a year earlier, we are now entering the mobile browsing era.

##### 20012 - Chrome is King

By now Firefox should be the top browser but four years after entering the browser race, Chrome is king. In only four years Chrome has almost of of the browser market share. Googles Android is also now king, holding a huge share of the mobile phone market.
