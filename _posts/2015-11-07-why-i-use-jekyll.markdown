I decided to give Jekyll a shot last week after reading a post that static content sites are the next big thing. I didn't quite buy this statement, static content websites seem to take major stepback in our Wordpress, Rails, Laravel world. How could you ever power a large scale blog platform with 20+ authors without using a CMS and no backend? 2 days into using Jekyll so far, I don't think you can, atleast not without completely upending your current workflow for everyone. Editors will need to atleast learn markdown in order to post, editors will probably need a copy of the blog running on there machines to properly load the blog to test.

Even with the above issues, having a static content website was still pretty intriguing to me. I've wanted to start a blog for a few months now, but I didn't want to take the timeout to download wordpress, setup a database and start posting. 

### Why I like Jekyll so far

* Very simple to get things setup and going. No need to setup a database, no need to run. Altough you will need to run some command line commands to get Jekyll up and running on your computer. 
* I get a reason to further learn markdown. Sure i know a bit from writing README.md files, but I now get the oppurnity to write all my content in markdown
* Very few moving parts. The only part the really moves is running 'Jekyll Build' which builds you're site into a static files.
* It's super fast. Pages load in under a second.
* The templating makes sense. If you've ever used a templating engine before weather its Laraval blade or Javascripts Mustache, you can use Jekyll


### The cons
* No plugins to handle SEO for you. No Yoast! Seo is all on you. But that's also an opppurnity to brush up on your SEO skills i guess.
* No real eco system. So
* Since it's makrdown, theres no spell check
* No easy way to handle assets
