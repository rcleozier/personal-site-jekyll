Starting a new year for me usually involves me getting excited about of all the projects that I want to complete the upcoming year. Realistically, I'll be looking at this back at this list in December and wondering what happened?

Where do you want to be in December this year? This is the question I now ask myself before deciding which projects to start. Does this project align with that idea?

This year I want to create my own side scrolling 2D game. I would also love to start another blog where I'm writing 1-2 post per week.

The programmer/gamer in my would immediately start working on the 2D game. I'm simply more excited about the prospects of writing my own game. Do I want to be a game developer? No, not really. I would much rather be a great writer. I guess that answers which project to start.

Think strongly about what you want to accomplish and not just want would be fun to work on.
